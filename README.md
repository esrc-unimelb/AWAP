The dataset also contains records about photographs of women and themes that have been researched (such as rural women). There are currently (as at August 2016) 6183 entries (women, organisations, concepts, artefacts) with references to 3008 archival resources, 7171 published resources and 914 digital resources, such as photographs and sound files.
