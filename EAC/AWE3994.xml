<biogHist>
<abstract>Merrilyn Pedergnana received a Citizenship Award on Australia Day in 1998 in recognition of countless hours of voluntary work for various nonprofit organisations in Broken Hill, New South Wales, and beyond. She is a first aid trainer for St John Ambulance Australia.</abstract>
<p>Merrilyn Pedergnana was the third child of returned serviceman Lloyd McFeeters and his wife, Vera. Lloyd had served with the AIF during World War Two. On his death in 1956, Merrilyn and her siblings - Wendy, John and Peter - became Legacy Wards. Merrilyn was educated at Burke Ward school, and later at Broken Hill High School.</p>
<p>In 1964, Merrilyn began work at the <span style="font-style:italic">Barrier Miner</span> newspaper, and later at the Zinc Mine as a print machine operator. She met her husband, Reg, in her first year of work and the pair were married when Reg returned home from National Service in 1970. Faced with the mine's policy of no employment for married women, Merrilyn took a position with Thorp Motors in Broken Hill. In 1973 she gave birth to her daughter, Angela, followed in 1974 by her son, Carl.</p>
<p>In 1980 Merrilyn began a career in child care, looking after the children of working parents, which she maintained for eighteen years. During this time she undertook voluntary work for various groups including the Scouts, netball, the National Servicemen's Association, the Navalmen's Association, St John Ambulance Australia, the Broken Hill Rifle Club, the No. 9 Rifle Association, the Italo International Club, the Broken Hill City Council, the Broken Hill Gallipoli Memorial Foundation, and the Town Employees Union.</p>
<p>Merrilyn Pedergnana is the only woman to hold life membership of the National Servicemen's Association of Australia. In 1998 she was honoured with a Citizenship Award on Australia Day. Merrilyn is an active trainer and examiner of first aid for St John Ambulance Australia, responsible for all first aid training in western New South Wales. In 2008 she was awarded the St John Ambulance Australia Long Service Medal.</p>
