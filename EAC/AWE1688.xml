<biogHist>
<abstract>Lindy Morrison, well known drummer and musician, joined the Australian Democrats to bring about change. She stood as their candidate in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly elections for Coogee in 2003 and for the House of Representatives seat of Wentworth in 2004.</abstract>
<p>Lindy Morrison is best known for her musical career. She was a member of the 1980s band, the Go-Betweens, and played with Zero (sometimes spelt Xero or Xiro) and Cleopatra Wong.</p>
<p>Lindy Morrison grew up in Queensland and her first job was as a social worker in Aboriginal community centres, an experience she said, fundamentally changed her life. Later, after two years in England, she returned home and turned to acting in political theatre at factories in Queensland. Then she moved into punk music and joined the Go-Betweens, touring Australia and the world. When the band broke up in 1990, Lindy Morrison changed her lifestyle and settled in Sydney. She has campaigned strongly for performers' rights and has been a board member of the Phonographic Performance Company of Australia (PPCA) since 1993. She has worked as musical director or performer in shows, parades and festivals and has lead drum and music workshops with many groups.</p>
<p>She is a director of the Music Council of Australia Board and is national co-ordinator for Support Act Ltd, the benevolent society for musicians and workers in the music industry.<br />
She campaigned on performers rights under the Free Trade Agreement in 2004-5. She has one daughter.</p>
