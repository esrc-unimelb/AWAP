<biogHist>
<abstract>An indefatigable worker and a contributor to every community in which she lived, Dorothy Frank stood as an Independent candidate for Temora in 1968 and was elected Alderman of Temora Municipal Council.</abstract>
<p>Dorothy Frank was born in Wingham, NSW, the 2<sup>nd</sup> daughter of Richard and Mary Jane Wallace, dairy farmers. She was educated to Intermediate examination at the Wingham District School and later at the Taree Technical College, where she studied typing and shorthand. She worked as an office worker in Wingham while studying bookkeeping and accountancy. She married Norman Austral Frank, dairy farmer, on 18 July 1944, and they had four children.</p>
<p>Their youngest daughter needed medical treatment, so the family moved to Baulkham Hills. Dorothy became the secretary for the Parramatta Veterinary Hospital and later set up her own business The Hills Secretarial and Duplicating Service. During this time she became involved in the Girl Guide Movement, the local Progress Association and the Baulkham Hills Chamber of Commerce, of which she was the inaugural secretary.</p>
<p>After the Baulkham Hills business was sold, the Franks bought a hotel in Temora, and later a farmlet in the area. While living in Temora, Dorothy was elected to the Temora Municipal Council, the first woman alderman. When the council was amalgamated with the Narraburah Shire Council, she was again the only woman member.</p>
<p>Following this success, Dorothy decided to run for election to the Legislative Assembly and was disappointed in the result, after travelling the electorate. In Temora she was patron of the Red Cross branch and Vice President of the local RSPCA branch.</p>
<p>Later, she and her husband bought a farm in Cobram, Victoria, which they ran until 1991 when they moved back to NSW and settled in Dapto. In both Cobram and Dapto, Dorothy joined community organisations and usually held office in them.</p>
