<biogHist>
<abstract>Elva Batt enlisted in the Australian Army on 29 October 1941. Originally a Voluntary Aid she later joined the Australian Army Medical Women's Service. Batt was then transferred to the Australian Women's Army Service.

Before attending the Australian Women's Services Officers Training School, Batt was a sergeant working as a clerk in the orderly room. Upon completion of the course she was promoted to Lieutenant (later Captain) and became an Amenities Officer with the Australian Women's Army Service.

It was Batt's job to organize sporting events (i.e. swimming carnivals, basketball matches, etc.) and entertainment and to oversee the supply of goods from the Canteen Funds, such as bedspreads, irons, jugs, sewing machines etc., to make a servicewoman's tent or hut seem like home. [1]

Nearing the end of the war, Batt was transferred to Melbourne Headquarters to oversee the disbanding of the Australian Women's Army Service. She was discharged on 28 June 1946.

Later, in 1946, she married Barry Batt and they had two children. Batt states that one of her major challenges was now having to cook, as during the previous five years all meals had been cooked for enlisted personnel.

In retirement Batt and her husband became volunteer members of the Royal Blind Society (New South Wales). She has been president of the ex-AAMWAS Association of New South Wales for eight years.

<abstract>Mrs Batt was a ballet mistress who enlisted as an Army Amenities officer in 1943 in the Northern Territory.She discusses the entertainment provided by the army for the troops: revues, dances. She mentions conditions in Darwin during the war,including the general feeling of the population: tedium, neglect by the rest of the country. The civilian population in Perth felt isolated and had a harder time as regards rationing than did the service personnel.Mrs Batt comments that entertainers were very important to keep up the morale of the troops.
