<abstract>History of Nursing in South Australia  

Jenny Leak was born in Adelaide, South Australia. She began her career as an assistant nurse at the Wakefield Street Private Hospital and in 1954 began training at that hospital. Following paediatric nursing and midwifery training Jenny worked at the Streaky Bay Hospital for two years, and at the Point McLeay Aboriginal Reserve for six months. After infant welfare training in 1963 she was appointed Night Sister and later Deputy Matron at the Wakefield Street Hospital. In 1966 Jenny was a member of a surgical team working in Bien Hoa, Vietnam, for six months. Subsequently she remained in Vietnam where she administered a community aid program for children. Since her return to Adelaide in 1976 Jenny has undertaken a series of post-basic courses in nursing. After an appointment with the Child Adolescent and Family Health Service she joined the staff of the South Australian College of Advanced Education (Sturt Campus) in 1987.</abstract>
