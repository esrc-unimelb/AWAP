<biogHist>
<abstract>The Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS) was established on 13 August 1941, to release men from certain military duties for service with fighting units. The Service recruited women between the ages of 18 and 45 and they served in a variety of roles including clerks, typists, cooks and drivers. In 1945 a contingent was sent to Lae and a small group went to Holland. In June 1947, owing to the end of World War II, the AWAS was disbanded.</abstract>
<p>On 13 August 1941 the War Cabinet of the Australian Government gave approval for the Formation and Control of an Australian Army Women's Service to release men from military duties for employment with fighting units. The name was later changed to Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS).</p>
<p>From the time of the appointment of the Controller AWAS on 29 September 1941, until cessation of hostilities in August 1945, 24,026 women enlisted as volunteers in the Service.</p>
<p>Hitherto there had been no women accepted by the Army except those in the Medical Services and the potentialities of women in other trades and professions had not been utilised. In addition, as the Service expanded women with no particular qualifications, apart from general intelligence were used in various occupations where willingness to serve and general adaptability were the main requirements.</p>
<p>The first 29 officers were a representative selection of Australian women appointed after many women had been interviewed in each State. It was considered essential that those selected for the first officers appointments should have proved themselves as leaders in their own trade or profession or in some form of community service. They were expected to have qualities of enthusiasm and confidence in the contribution which women could take to the Army, balance and dependability in carrying through a task, consideration for the requirements and needs of other women, and most importantly, tact and patience necessary for pioneering a new organisation.</p>
<p>The first Officer's Training School was held in Victoria in November-December 1941. During this time Japan entered the war and the need for womanpower in the Army was accentuated, recruiting and training commenced as soon as AWAS Officers returned to their areas. The types of recruits were quite splendid, alert, responsible and invariably inspired to volunteer by strong personal motives.</p>
<p>Initially the Army only envisaged that women would be employed as clerks, typists, cooks and motor transport drivers, and in small numbers, however, the demand grew very quickly and by the end of 1942 12,000 recruits had been enlisted and trained.</p>
<p>While at first AWAS were posted only to Headquarters, and Base Installations, they later took up duty, after specialist training in almost all Army Services. It is of interest to note that 3,618 served with the Royal Australian Artillery and they manned the Fixed Defences of Australia from Hobart in the South and Cairns in the North, and Perth in the West. And again 3,600 served in the Australian Corps of Signals, where they proved themselves well adapted for the type of work required of them.</p>
<p>Officers and other ranks of the Australian Intelligence Corps were commended for highly secret work. Motor transport drivers had truly varied lives driving cars, ambulances, trucks (up to 3 tons), jeeps, floating jeeps, Bren Gun Carriers, amphibious vehicles and driving convoys in all weathers. Australian Army Ordnance Corps employed 2,600 on a variety of tasks, some requiring a high degree of skill and all a marked degree of patience and perseverance. While quite unusual and somewhat trying work was carried out at the Proof and Experimental Range. Cooks, caterers and canteen workers were just as important as skilled Cipher clerks. There were several butchers in the AWAS.</p>
<p>In 1945 War Cabinet gave special approval for 500 AWAS to serve outside Australia. These members were posted to HQ 1st Aust. Army in New Guinea, 350 were selected and sailed on the MV Duntroon in May 1945.</p>
<p>In 1946, 1 Officer, 3 NCO's, and 1 Private AWAS were included in the Army quota of 160 personnel in the Victory March contingent for London June 1946.</p>
<p>During 5 ½ years AWAS served throughout Australia from Darwin to Hobart, in populous parts and in some very lonely places. Each one according to her character and talents served Australia faithfully and well.<br />
The Service was disbanded in June 1947.</p>

<abstract>"Which way would the wind blow ?". Mrs Wood was a member of the Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS) during the 1939-1945 war and then accompanied her husband, who was a member of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), to Japan in 1945. This very descriptive memoir deals with the period in BCOF and gives insights into a woman's life in post war Japan, much is written from the domestic point of view.</abstract>

<unittitle>Interview with Jean Scott (When the war came to Australia)</unittitle>
<unitid>F04036</unitid>
<unitdate>15 February 1991</unitdate>
<abstract>Mrs Jean Scott was a member of the Australian Women's Land Army, (AWLA) which was formed to do the manual labour on farms, in place of the men who had gone to war. There were 6000 AWLA girls in the Commonwealth; 3,500 permanent and the rest seasonal workers. She enlisted at the age of nineteen and left the city to take up various postings including Griffith and Ballarat. She mostly worked on fruit and vegetables and handled horses. Eight five per cent of the girls in the AWLA were city girls, who adapted well to work in the country. The country girls avoided the AWLA and preferred the Women's Army Auxilary Corps (WAAC) and Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS). There were no perks or rehabilitation offered to the girls of the AWLA. The girls had limited contact with American soldiers; Mrs Scott wrote to three for sometime. They were lonely young men, she thinks. The experience broadened her outlook on life, and she has only happy memories of the time. She has published a book on the Land Army; released in 1986. A poem: "Land Girl's Lament" is included in her interview.</abstract>

<unittitle>Australian servicewomen's memorial</unittitle>
<unitid>ART90968</unitid>
<unitdate>1999</unitdate>
<abstract>Whereas more conventional war memorials may incorporate a cenotaph or a representative figure, Anne Ferguson has created a bare platform of coloured stones, divided in two by a curved trench that resembles an aerial view of a river, carving its way through a sparse, flat landscape. While most memorials encourage audiences to keep a reverential distance, to stand outside the experience of war and reflect upon it, Ferguson wants the viewer to walk right into the middle of the work, to experience a sense of empathy with the women it celebrates. The insignia of the women's services are displayed discreetly around the mosaic, because for Ferguson, ceremony is far less important than the human dimension. For many women, the work they undertook during the Second World War provided a first taste of freedom and responsibility. When the war ended and those jobs were given back to the men, it must have come as a bitter blow, because their lives and way of thinking had already been changed. It is this sense of metamorphosis that Ferguson has tried to capture in her stone mosaic, in which the variegated colours represent the different lives, the different backgrounds and experiences of servicewomen. Set in a peaceful grove between the deciduous trees, the sculpture changes the appearance in relation to the changes in daylight, the play of shadows, and the sprinkling of leaves that fall haphazardly onto the stone. Ferguson draws a parallel between the gradual process of awakening to the environment in which we live, and a growing recognition of the debt we owe to those men and women who gave their time, and their lives, in defence of this land. Her stone platform may be undemonstrative, but it has a feeling of underlying strength. It is a foundation upon which new recognitions can be built.

The choirmaster, Lew Dawe, a Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) representative is standing on the far left. He organised a choir of forty from all services to sing carols around the Darwin area at Christmas 1944, including hospitals and barracks. The choir also visited the navy ships anchored in the harbour. The St George's Chapel, built by voluntary labour using bamboo for the walls, was used for church parades by all denominations.
