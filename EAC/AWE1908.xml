<biogHist>
<abstract>A once only candidate, who went on to successfully follow her profession. Therese McGee stood as an ALP candidate in the 1981 New South Wales Legislative Assembly elections for Northcott.</abstract>
<p>Educated at Loreto College, Normanhurst, Terry went on to the University of Sydney where she graduated with first class honours in Medicine (MBBS). She did her residency at Concord Repatriation Hospital then worked with the Aboriginal Medical Service in western New South Wales and with the Workers' Health Centre at Lidcombe. She worked for some years in Zimbabwe, where she indulged in her love for obstetrics. On her return to Australia she completed her specialist training and became of member of the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.</p>
<p>Terry McGee was an office holder in the ALP at local and state electorate level, and was Vice President of Young Labor. She was also an elected delegate to the Labor Annual Conference and the Labor Women's Committee.</p>
<p>By 2003, she was on the staff of the Adolescent Health/ Medicine at the Children's Hospital Westmead and working as an obstetrician and gynaecologist. A serious hearing problem and the subsequent search for hearing improvement has meant that by 2005 she was working part time in her specialty. She is the author of a novel based on her experiences, <span style="font-style:italic">Misconceptions: a novel of birth, death and what happens in between</span>, published in 2003 by Pan Macmillan.</p>
<p>Terry McGee is a member of the Doctors' Reform Society. In July 2005 she was appointed to the Federal Government Committee charged with making an independent review of Assisted Reproduction Technologies.</p>
