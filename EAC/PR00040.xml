<biogHist>
<abstract>In 1988 a small group of Adelaide women formed the Women's Environmental Action Group, to educate people on environmental issues effecting their lives and how they could help change things

</abstract>
<p>The Women's Environmental Action Group members undertook a schools program in their area teaching children about recycling and paper making. They made a submission on waste management in Australia. They staged protest actions at supermarkets against excessive packaging, and in shopping centres placing stickers on toy guns as a protest against war and the first Gulf War. They protested the Roxby Downs uranium shipments, noting down container numbers to send to protesters in other countries. The undertook Nurrunga and yellow cake actions to increase awareness about uranium. The Port Adelaide local government area became a nuclear free zone and the women put up signs to celebrate this. The banner in the photographs at the International Women's Day was confiscated by the police and longer exists. They wrote articles for 'Liberation', the Adelaide Women's Liberation Newsleter. Members included Silver Moon, Doris Horvath, Kate Lawrence, Seja Sims, and Sally Sims.</p>

<unittitle>Women Against Nuclear Energy </unittitle>
<unitdate>21 April 1980 - </unitdate>
<abstract>Women Against Nuclear Energy (WANE) was formed out of a growing concern for, and a desire for action on, uranium mining and nuclear power. The women who founded WANE were members of the Campaign Against Nuclear Energy (CANE) but felt that sexism inherent in the hierarchical structure of CANE left women's voices unheard. As such, the members of WANE felt that their direction and means for attaining their goal of a nuclear-free future had diverged from that of CANE, and WANE was formed. The two groups maintained strong links, as well as links to other women's anti-nuclear groups and women's peace groups.

WANE's objectives included educating and activation of women, outside of appealing to women as mothers and carers. The exclusion of males was felt to better enable this, providing women with an environment free from the constraints of sexism that were felt to be inherent in the hierarchical structure of other anti-nuclear groups.
WANE aimed to work with women's groups in unions against uranium, and educate and empower women to share this message amongst other women. The group's primary concerns were regarding a nuclear-free future, as well as support for migrant and Indigenous women, and the support and investigation of alternative energy. WANE believed the implications of a solar future where inherent in feminist theory (for example, people before profits).
WANE produced and distributed a newsletter to its members. The group also helped organise Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament (WAND), supported women's only actions such as the Sound Women's Peace Camp in Western Australia and held dances to raise money.
