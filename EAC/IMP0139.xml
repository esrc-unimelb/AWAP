<p>Vera Deakin was born at "Llanarth" South Yarra, the youngest of the three daughters of Alfred and Pattie Deakin. She was educated first by her aunt - Catherine (Katie) Deakin who was an accomplished pianist. Vera then attended the Melbourne Church of England Girl's Grammar School. She also studied the 'cello and singing'. In 1913 she travelled with her aunt as chaperone to Berline and Budapest where she was a student at the Singing School and conservatorium of Music.</p>
<p>During World War I, in 1915 with Winifred Johnson, she sailed to Cairo and set up, organised and administered the 'Wounded and Missing Enquiry Bureau' of the Australian Red Cross Society. In 1916, when Australian troops were sent to the Western Front, Vera and Winifred sailed to London, Vera with assistance of many Australian and English women including Lilian Whybrow (later Scantlebury) transferred the Bureau of London.<br />

Later she became president 1961-66, then Vice-president in 1966 and worked on their committees until she was in her late 80's. She was a member of the Limbless Soldiers Melba Welfare Trust from 1930. In 1935 she took her mother Pattie Deakin's place as Trustee of the Sir Samuel McCaughey Bequest for the education of the children of deceased or incapacitated soldiers. She was the founder and President of The Anzac Fellowship of the Women of Victoria from its inauguration in 1935 until the 1950's and then again from the 1960's until her death. She was for many years on the Council of the Melbourne Church of England Girls' Grammar School.</p>
<p>Prior to World War II she helped the Victorian Division of Red Cross organise Emergency Training Groups and helped put in motion the mobilisation plans is 1939 all over Victoria. She with Lilian Scantlebury were Divisional Commandants and Honorary Directors of the Inquiry Bureau, as well as the Prisoner of War Department and Message Service to Occupied Europe from 1939-46. She was Vice-Chairman of the Society from 1949-51when she went to London when her husband was appointed Australian High Commissioner in London. While in London she was on the Council for the Care of Cripples and represented Australian Red Cross at conferences.
