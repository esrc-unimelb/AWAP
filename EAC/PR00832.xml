<biogHist>
<abstract>The Central Victorian Women in Agriculture group was formed in the aftermath of the First International Women in Agriculture Conference.  Many of its orginal members had helped to organise the conference, and the organisation aimed to support women of Central Victoria to achieve the goals highlighted by the conference:   to establish a supportive network, stimulate women to recognise and value their skills and abilities, to give women the chance to gain confidence and make a difference in their industry and community, to encourage and provide knowledge and practical skills, and to strengthen Australian agriculture through strong partnerships. The organisation was successful in its aims, its members going on to positions on industy boards, as representatives of state and national organisations, and in local government , and it was wound up in 2006.

<p>The Central Victorian Women in Agriculture Group was formed in the aftermath of the 1994 First International Women in Agriculture Conference. Women from the area, including Janet Barker, Joy Chambers, Laurene Dietrich, Audrey Drechsler and Maureen Walsh, had been closely involved with the organisation of the Conference. The aims of the group reflected the needs highlighted by the Conference, and the aims of the Women in Agriculture Movement as a whole: to establish a supportive network, stimulate women to recognise and value their skills and abilities, to give women the chance to gain confidence to 'step out of their comfort zone' to make a difference in their industry and community, to encourage and provide knowledge and practical skills, and to strengthen Australian agriculture through strong partnerships. The group incorporated, and produced a newsletter. It was involved in skills and leadership education and lobbied politicians, it organised a Shire rate deferral for those affected by drought, and hosted exchanges form other areas, and from overseas. The group, at the instigation of Joy Chambers, was responsible for the establishment of the Knickers Fund, set up to provide small comforts to women in areas affected by disaster. They also organised the 1997 Women on Farms Gathering in Bendigo. By 2004, with many of their members serving on Boards, as district representatives of State and National Organisations, or elected to Municipal Councils, and other wise active in their communities, the organisation had served its purpose, and in 2006 it disbanded. It's banner is now with the Women on Farms Gathering Collection at Museum Victoria.</p>
