<biogHist>
<abstract>A tireless campaigner and activist for over fifty years, Irene Adelaide Greenwood's interests in feminism and the peace movement were formed through her mother Mary Driver's involvement with the Women's Services Guild. The achievements of Greenwood's life's work are considerable and her commitment and energy was recognized in the many awards bestowed on her. These include Member of the Order of Australia, the first woman to receive an Honorary Doctorate at Murdoch University, recognition as the strategist behind the implementation of the Chair in Peace Studies at Murdoch University, the United Nations Association of Australia Silver Peace Medal and honorary life membership, Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal, appointment to the National Advisory Committee on Women's Affairs in 1974 and the naming of the flagship of the State ship's fleet <span style="font-style:italic">M.V. Irene Greenwood</span> in her honour. Greenwood was also a life or honorary member of many key international, national and state peace and women's organizations.</abstract>
<p>As early as 1916 Irene Greenwood was sensitized to issues of social justice sharing her mother's concern for the oppression of Aborigines and women. In 1920 she participated in Perth's first strike by civil servants marking the beginning of a long career in political activism. In 1931 she moved from Perth to Sydney where she began a career in broadcasting, at the same time developing a radical political consciousness and experience in the women's movement. Returning to Perth in 1935 she worked on the ABC's Women's Session and then moved to commercial radio instituting the popular Woman to Woman programme. Greenwood retired from radio in 1953. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, she intensified her involvement in the women's and peace movements, traveling as a delegate to national conferences and forums and in 1965 to The Hague and Zurich for the Golden Jubilee Congress of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She edited <span style="font-style:italic">Peace and Freedom</span> the official organ for Women's International League for Peace and Freedom until she was into her seventies. Locally Greenwood was party to the formation of the Western Australian Council for Equal Pay and Opportunity and edited <span style="font-style:italic">Equal Pay News</span> for the duration of the organization's existence. She participated in the foundation of Western Australian branches of the Family Planning Association, the Abortion Law Repeal Association, Women's Liberation and Women's Electoral Lobby. Greenwood expressed a special love for history, organising displays of the founders of the Women's Movement and documenting the history of Western Australian women's organizations and feminism. She bestowed a vast archive of unique and rare material relating to women and the peace movement to Murdoch University.</p>
<p>(As Giles (1999) notes Greenwood publicly changed her date of birth to 1899 to coincide with the year that non-Indigenous women won the vote in Western Australia)</p>

<unittitle>The Irene Greenwood Collection</unittitle>
<unitdate>1890 - 1970s</unitdate>
<abstract>This expansive archive was created throughout Irene Greenwood's lifetime as a broadcaster, activist and participant in the peace and women's movements. Greenwood kept meticulous and detailed notes and records, and the collection attests to the broad reach of her intellectual and activist endeavour. It includes 2,500 catalogued books, many with personal inscriptions and memoranda to Greenwood from the authors and notes Greenwood used in her broadcasts and writing still in the books; dated inwards and outwards correspondence with organizations with which Greenwood had membership or was associated; correspondence with newspapers and editorial staff; Greenwood's personal diaries; scripts and reel to reel tapes of all the radio programs Greenwood wrote, produced and presented; ephemera and newspaper cuttings collected over many years of relevance to international, national and state feminism, women's organisations and the peace movement. The audio collection includes interviews with Greenwood detailing her personal thoughts on many aspects of Western Australia's women's and peace movements and recordings that she made to guide researchers through the history of these organisations. There are videos produced by and featuring Greenwood, a film about her life and original documents and material relating to feminism and the peace movement collected by her mother Mary Driver.</abstract>
