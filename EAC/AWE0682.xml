<biogHist>
<abstract>Alison Gent, n√©e Hogben, was born at Rose Park, Adelaide and brought up by her widowed working mother. She attended Walford School and went on to gain an MA at Adelaide University. She married an Anglican priest in 1947 and they had five children. In 1970, Alison returned to part-time tutoring and saw publicity about the proposed Women's Liberation Movement, and she became heavily involved in its activities. In 1980, the year that Alison and her husband separated, she began a discussion group about the ordination of women, her interest stemming in part from her personal frustration. She became involved in the Movement for the Ordination of Women, which began in Adelaide in 1984. She remains a committed Christian and feminist.</abstract>

<abstract>Alison Gent, nee Hogben, was born at Rose Park, Adelaide and brought up by her widowed working mother. Alison attended Walford School and went on to gain an MA at Adelaide University. She married an Anglican priest in 1947 and they had five children. She explains her deep interest in the church and her awareness of inequities for women. Alison returned to part-time tutoring and saw publicity about the proposed Women's Liberation Movement in 1970. She describes early activities, including marches and demonstrations. In 1980, the year that Alison and her husband separated, she began a discussion group about the ordination of women, her interest stemming in part from her personal frustration. She also explains her involvement in the Movement for the Ordination of Women, which began in Adelaide in 1984, and her continuing commitment to both Christianity and feminism.
