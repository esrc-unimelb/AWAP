<biogHist>
<abstract>An environmentalist and local and political activist. Jane Bange was an Australian Greens Party candidate for South Coast in 1999 and 2003, and in the House of Representatives for Gilmore in 1998 and 2001. She was a member of the Shoalhaven City Council between 1999 and 2004.</abstract>
<p>Jane Bange grew up in Brisbane, and attended Queensland University on an Army scholarship to study Dentistry. After graduation she worked as an Army Dental Officer for four years, before leaving to travel overseas. She was later employed in private practice in Sydney and in the country.<br />
Meeting Bill Mollison and learning of the concept of Permaculture, led to her membership of the Greens Party and a change in the direction of her life. She retrained as a remedial massage therapist.<br />
She was elected to the Shoalhaven City Council in 1999 and during her term on Council, worked on many committees including the Development, Policy and Planning and Youth Advisory committees.<br />
Jane is an active member of local groups of Amnesty International, the Australian Conservation Foundation and Oxfam-Community Aid Abroad. She is also involved with Shoalhaven Women for Reconciliation and is Secretary of the Friends of the Brush-tailed Rock Wallaby.</p>
<p>Jane was presented with a Certificate of Service to the Shoalhaven City Council when, in 2004, she decided not to seek re-election to the council. At the time she hoped to undertake a role as a dentist in East Timor.</p>
