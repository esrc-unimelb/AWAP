<biogHist>
<abstract>Sara Dowse is a prize-winning writer of reviews and Canberra-themed fiction. A feminist and women's rights activist, she was a member of the Women's Liberation Movement and the Women's Electoral Lobby-ACT. She became the inaugural head of the Women's Affairs Section of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (now Office of the Status of Women) for the Whitlam government.


(<span style="font-style:italic">This entry is sponsored by generous donation from Christine Foley.</span>)</abstract>
<p>Born in Chicago, USA, Sara Dowse (nee Rosenthal) grew up in Hollywood, the daughter of an actor mother and celebrity lawyer father. Born of Jewish parents, she experienced anti-semitism in her early years, and left for Australia at nineteen (in 1958) when she married a visiting Australian footballer.</p>
<p>She studied Arts at Sydney University, and after experiencing sexism as a pregnant student and in society generally, she became what has been described as an 'old-style feminist'.</p>
<p>She arrived in Canberra in 1968 and worked as a journalist, publisher's field editor and tutor at the Canberra College of Advanced Education. She was a member of the Women's Liberation Movement and the Women's Electoral Lobby-ACT, and became the inaugural head of the Women's Affairs Section of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (now the Office of the Status of Women) for the Whitlam government. At the time of her appointment, she was dubbed 'Supergirl' by the press.</p>
<p>Dowse became spokesperson for 130 organisations that opposed the removal of lawfully performed abortions from the medical benefits scheme.</p>
<p>After a publicised resignation from the public service, she worked as a teacher at The Australian National University, a reviewer for newspapers and journals, and became a writer of novels and short stories. She has also been an interviewer for the National Library of Australia's Oral History Program. She was forty-five when her first novel, <span style="font-style:italic">West Block</span>, based on her experiences in the Prime Minister's department, was published in 1983.</p>
<p>Dowse's other books include <span style="font-style:italic">Silver City</span> (1984), <span style="font-style:italic">Schemetime</span> (1990), <span style="font-style:italic">Sapphires</span> (1994) - a largely autobiographical work about rediscovering Jewish roots - and <span style="font-style:italic">Digging</span> (1996). She has contributed to <span style="font-style:italic">Worth Her Salt: Women at Work in Australia</span> (1982); <span style="font-style:italic">Leaving School, It's Harder for Girls</span> (1983); <span style="font-style:italic">Women, Social Welfare and the State</span> (1983), <span style="font-style:italic">Sisterhood is Global</span> (1984) and <span style="font-style:italic">Home Grown Anthology</span> (1993).</p>
<p>She was a member of Seven Writers - a group of seven Canberra-based writers whose work vividly portrayed life 'beneath the surface of Canberra' - and as part of this collective she contributed to <span style="font-style:italic">Canberra Tales</span> (1988), republished as <span style="font-style:italic">The Division of Love</span> in 1996, an anthology of short stories about life in Canberra. The work received an ACT Bicentennial Award.</p>
<p>Dowse has also been awarded the AIPS/APSA Women in Politics Prize (1982); 3M/Royal Blind Society Talking Book of the Year (1994); ACT Book of the Year (1995); ACT Book Reviewer of the Year (1995 and joint winner in 1997 with Marion Halligan). She was short-listed for the Steele Rudd Award (1995) and long-listed for the IMPAC Dublin Prize (1996). She has also been the recipient of an Australia Council fellowship; a Harold White Fellowship (1991) and an ACT Literary Fellowship (1996).</p>
<p>Sara Dowse has five children.</p>

<unitid>ORAL TRC 2651</unitid>
<unitdate>c. 1970 - 1990</unitdate>
<abstract>Ryan speaks of the National Foundation for Australian Women, its history and aim to promote feminist ideas into the far future, how the composition of members has changed over the years, the changes to home-based women, the advent of "second-wave" feminism, the history of the women's movement in Canberra starting formally in June 1978, previously operated informally from 1969 as an off-shoot from the Sydney group lead by Lyndal Ryan, how the movement grew through networking, why their meetings were closed to men, how 1972 saw an increase in political involvement with their support of the Aboriginal Embassy tent and the establishment of the Women's Electoral Lobby, their resistance to takeovers by both moderate and extreme political groups, the opportunity feminists had during the Whitlam years to gain influence in the bureaucracy with the appointment of Elizabeth Reid in 1973 as Whitlam's adviser on women's issues, how the group engaged in consciousness-raising, the emergence of femocrats like Mary Menange and Anne Somers threatened to depower women by transferring too much responsibility to government bodies, the highlights of 1975 as International Women's Year and its contribution to the Labour Government dismissal, how feminism eventually influenced the right-wing of politics, the relationship between gender and class in social oppression, the move from Marxist politics to post-modern Foucault models for change and the emergence of women's studies as a discipline.</abstract>
