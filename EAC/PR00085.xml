Their first protest was against the Miss Fresher competition, which gain media exposer to their ideas of women's liberation. Public meetings where called and the broader community involvement brought about the establishment of the Women's Liberation Movement housed at Bloor House. They provided an environment where ideas for supporting women'd rights were fostered.

<unitdate>1972 - </unitdate>
<abstract>Tuesday Afternoon Group are a group of older women who joined the second wave of feminism in the 1970s whose issues were outside the main stream of feminist concerns of that time. These women were politically active both on older women's needs such as housing, but also international political issues facing women in the third world. Molly Brannigan had attended the Decade of Women Conference in Mexico in 1975 and had gained a greater understanding of the needs of all women world wide. The women met at the Women's Advisory Service to discuss issues each Tueday Afternoon.</abstract>
