<abstract>Toni Turnbull, n√©e Richmore, was born in Japan where her father was stationed. Toni went to school in several countries and matriculated at an Adelaide Catholic girls school. She began Science at Adelaide University before transferring to Medicine. In her fourth year Toni married, and in her final year her first child was born. Working for the Family Planning Association and in general practice, Toni became increasingly disturbed by the number of women seeking abortions for convenience. In the early 1980s Toni came to believe that God was asking her to speak out and she also became convinced of the extent of post-abortion grief.</abstract>

<abstract>Antonia Mary Turnbull, nee Richmore, was born in Japan where her father was stationed. Toni went to school in several countries and matriculated at an Adelaide Catholic girls school. She began Science at Adelaide University before transferring to Medicine. In her fourth year Toni married, and in her final year her first child was born. Toni describes experiences crucial to her later activism: participating in an abortion during her pregnancy, and caring for her baby as a resident at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Working for the Family Planning Association and in general practice, Toni became increasingly disturbed by the number of women seeking abortions for convenience. In the early 1980s Toni came to believe that God was asking her to speak out and she also became convinced of the extent of post-abortion grief. She discuss specific issues in the pro-life/pro-choice debate, as well as her identification with the women's movement.
