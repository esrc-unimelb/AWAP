<abstract>History of Nursing in South Australia

Barbara Parker, nee North, was born in Adelaide. After gaining the leaving certificate at the Methodist Ladies College she worked as a laboratory technician at the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science before commencing training at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in 1953. On completion of training she married but the early death of her husband necessitated her return to work in 1965. She was a tutor (unqualified) at Ru Rua Hospital and moved from there to a part-time appointment with the Public Health Department, where her role was to assist with medical examinations for new employees. In 1970 she became a full time member of the staff of the Occupational Health Branch of the PHD, where she is still employed (in the Occupational Health Unit of the South Austalian Health Commission). Barbara Parker has been actively involved in the professional affairs of nursing including the Occupational Health Nurses' Association.</abstract>
