<abstract>The Medical Women's Society of NSW was founded in 1921 to advance the interests of medically qualified women in professional practice. It was active in establishing the Australian Federation of Medical Women and continues to work for medical women in New South Wales.</abstract>

Currently, it also has representatives on the National Council of Women of New South Wales  and on the New South Wales Medical Defence Union.</p>
<p>Historically, the Society was involved in  achieving significant outcomes for medical women, including, obtaining equal rights on hospital residencies and pay.
