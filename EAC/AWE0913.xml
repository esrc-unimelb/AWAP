<abstract>Thelma Johnston was born in 1908 at Norton Summit and attended Norton Summit School until she was 12 years old. The family then moved to Adelaide and she went to the Methodist's Ladies College. Johnston was interested in craft work such as china painting, jewellery, enamelling and spinning and weaving and during World War II did work for the Red Cross shop and afterwards the "Acorn" craft shop. She and her husband were members of the Royal Yacht Squadron and Legacy. During the war she set up a kindergarten for children sent down from the islands because of the fear of a Japanese invasion. She was also involved with Flower Day and coordinated the Lyceum Club flower roster for 4 years and worked for many years for Meals on Wheels.</abstract>
