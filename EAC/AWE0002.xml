<abstract>The papers were received by the Library in 1991. They were once part of the collection of the Womens Studies Unit at the Australian National University. The papers consist mainly of secondary source material relating to women's issues. They include journal articles, newscuttings, notes, papers, reports, information circulars and women's journals. A substantial amount of the research material (6 folders) has been collected on the campaigns for equal pay for women both in Australia and overseas. Other subject files include
women and the media, women in the Australian Public Service and womens organisations. There are also papers from women's conferences and miscellaneous copies of various women's journals and newsletters.
The collection was arranged in files with titles when received by the Library. The arrangement of papers within these files and the file titles have been preserved by the Library. Other papers originally part of the Women's Archive and now held by the National Library include those of Beryl Henderson (MS 9360), Edna Ryan (MS 9140), and Thelma Hunter (MS 9353).</abstract>

<unittitle>Interview with Julia Ryan, feminist. Interviewer, Sara Dowse</unittitle>
<unitid>ORAL TRC 2651</unitid>
<unitdate>c. 1970 - 1990</unitdate>
<abstract>Ryan speaks of the National Foundation for Australian Women, its history and aim to promote feminist ideas into the far future, how the composition of members has changed over the years, the changes to home-based women, the advent of "second-wave" feminism, the history of the women's movement in Canberra starting formally in June 1978, previously operated informally from 1969 as an off-shoot from the Sydney group lead by Lyndal Ryan, how the movement grew through networking, why their meetings were closed to men, how 1972 saw an increase in political involvement with their support of the Aboriginal Embassy tent and the establishment of the Women's Electoral Lobby, their resistance to takeovers by both moderate and extreme political groups, the opportunity feminists had during the Whitlam years to gain influence in the bureaucracy with the appointment of Elizabeth Reid in 1973 as Whitlam's adviser on women's issues, how the group engaged in consciousness-raising, the emergence of femocrats like Mary Menange and Anne Somers threatened to depower women by transferring too much responsibility to government bodies, the highlights of 1975 as International Women's Year and its contribution to the Labour Government dismissal, how feminism eventually influenced the right-wing of politics, the relationship between gender and class in social oppression, the move from Marxist politics to post-modern Foucault models for change and the emergence of women's studies as a discipline.</abstract>
