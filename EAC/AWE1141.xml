<biogHist>
<abstract>The Australian Local Government Women's Association - New South Wales Branch was formed in Sydney in 1952 with Ald. Marjorie Proposting of Lane Cove Council as first president. Its formation was precipated by the formation of a national Australian Local Government Women's Association in Canberra the previous year. A non-party organisation, it was inspired particularly inspired by the belief that more women should be involved in local government partly because this arm of government was especially relevant to housewives and mothers.

Its aims are:
-to assist in furthering women's knowledge and understanding of the function of local government; to watch over and protect the interests and rights of women in local government; to take action in relation to any subject or activity of particular interest to women affecting local governing bodies or local government legislation; to encourage women to make a career in local government and to act in an advisory capacity to suitable women candidates for local government election.</abstract>
