<p>She returned to study in the late 1960s as graduated with honours in Psychology in 1973. She became a practicing psychologist at the Stockton Hospital where she worked until 1982.</p>
<p>She was the first Australian invited to use the Comintern archives when they were opened in 1990, as reward for her loyalty to Moscow after the Communist Party of Australia split in 1970.</p>
