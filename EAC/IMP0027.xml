<biogHist>
<abstract>On the 31 December 1977, Mary Durack was appointed to the Order of the British Empire, Dames Commander, for her services to literature. In acknowledgment of her accomplishments she was also honoured with an AC (1989) and OBE in 1966. Dame Mary Durack is remembered as being the author of publications that includes <span style="font-style:italic">Kings in Grass Castles, To Ride a Fine Horse, Sons in the Saddle</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Swan River Saga: Life of Early Pioneer Eliza Shaw.</span></abstract>
<p>Born in Adelaide South Australia, the daughter of Michael Patrick and Bessie Ida Muriel (n√©e Johnstone) Durack Mary's childhood was spent on the Argyle and Ivanhoe stations in the West Australian East Kimberley area. After being educated at Loreto Convent in Perth she returned to the family properties.</p>
<p>During her lifetime Mary became a prolific writer, with her first known work being <span style="font-style:italic">Little Poems of Sunshine</span> (1923). Mary and her sister Elizabeth, who also became a noted author, completed their first book together <span style="font-style:italic"> Allabout: The Story of a Black Community on Argyle Station, Kimberley</span> in 1935. Mary also wrote under the name of 'Virgilia' for <span style="font-style:italic">The West Australian</span> newspaper.</p>
<p>In 1987 Dame Mary Durack became a Fellow of Curtin University and was commended by the Childrens' Book Council in 1965 for <span style="font-style:italic">The Courteous Savage: Yagan of Swan River</span> (1964), illustrations by Elizabeth Durack. The title was changed to <span style="font-style:italic">Yagan of the Bibbulmun</span> (1976), illustrations by Revel Cooper, a Bibbulmun descendant, as 'savage' was now considered racist.</p>
<p>Dame Mary Durack was a director and patron of the Stockmans' Hall of Fame and Outback Heritage Centre, and a former executive member of the Aboriginal Cultural Foundation. She was a member of the Australian Society of Women Writers, The Royal Western Australian Historical Society, the National Trust and honorary life member of International PEN Australia.</p>
<p>The Australian Irish Heritage Association of WA conducts the Mary Durack Memorial Lecture commemorating the distinguished writer and their first patron. In 1979 the Western Australian Shires of Mundaring, Kalamunda and the Cities of Armadale and Swan established the Mary Durack Award.</p>
<p>On 2 December 1938 Mary married Capt. Horace Clive Miller OBE (died 1980) and they had six children.</p>

<unitid>ORAL TRC 3126</unitid>
<unitdate>1990 - 1991</unitdate>
<abstract>10 sound tape reels, 7 inch, and 74 page transcript. Dame Mary talks about her childhood and upbringing as well as life in Perth at the time. She described her rapport with Aboriginal people and her continuing affection for her Aboriginal 'sisters'. Various aspects of her literary career are covered including her work for radio, newspapers and magazines as well as the writing of the musical "Ship of Dreams" and the "Swan River Saga". Dame Mary discussed her writing during the time she was bringing up her six children, referring to time split between houses in Perth and Broome as well as school holidays spent writing at the coastal house of her friend Professor Ida Mann. This interview also includes one hour in which Dame Mary is joined by fellow author Nancy Keesing and this provides some reflections on Australian literary life, especially in regard to the Fellowship of Australian Writers and a workshop for Aboriginal writers which was held in Darwin in 1974.</abstract>
