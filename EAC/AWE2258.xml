<biogHist>
<abstract>May Mills was played a prominent role in the development of women's sport in South Australia. She was President of the South Australian Women's Cricket Association and the Australian Women's Cricket Council in the 1960s. Prior to that she was President of the South Australian Women's Amateur Sports Council, the body that successully lobbied the then Premier, Sir Thomas Playford, to secure access to playing fields for the dedicated use of women. Trained as a teacher, she taught at Unley High School for thirty years. She became the first female President of the South Australian Institute of Teachers in 1943.

Apart from her interest in women's sport and teaching, Mills was active in a number of other spheres of public life. She was the first President of the South Australian Film and Television Council, a founding member of the Australian College of Education, a Life Vice-President of the National Council of Women and a Life Member of the Royal Commonwealth Society. She was the first women in South Australia to secure a license to drive a motor car.

May Mills contribution to women's cricket was recognised in 1984/85 by the creation of the May Mills Trophy for the Under 18 national Championship. This competition ran until 1995/96.</abstract>
<p>The extent of Mills' involvement in public life gives proof to the old aphorism which tells us that if you want something done, ask a busy person. May Mills wasn't just busy, however, she was canny. She saved thousands of dollars of development costs by enticing major corporations to test their heavy machinery on the ovals, therefore getting them cleared and leveled at no cost to the sporting clubs. She organised parties of youngsters to plant almond trees around the oval and then, when the trees began to bear fruit, organised other children to harvest the crop, thus creating another source of funds through their sale.</p>

<unitid>OH 26/12</unitid>
<abstract>Broadcast 17 August 1969. 20 minutes. 
The opening announcement for this broadcast includes the following information: 'We have as our guest a lady who has long been a protagonist of women's interests in South Australia, and who has herself set an example of how diversified those interests can be in personal life. Miss May Mills was born at Millbrae in South Australia's Native Valley, the daughter of farming parents, and after learning and practising the tasks of running a farm, she turned to teaching as a career, and served in both primary and secondary schools, in country and city; but perhaps she is best remembered for her many years at Unley High School. She retired from teaching in 1960, but has long been an active member of the National Council of Women; was one of the founders of the South Australian Film and Television Council, is past President of the Royal Commonwealth Society, is President of the South Australian Women's Cricket Association, and she was the L.C.L. candidate for Edwardstown in 1961 State elections.'</abstract>
