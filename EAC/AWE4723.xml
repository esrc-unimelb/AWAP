Lili is a back up singer for an Elvis impersonator who gets stranded in a small coastal town.

<p>In 1997, she wrote the psychological thriller, <span style="font-style:italic">The Well.</span> The film is about two very different women who form a tender, yet manipulative, relationship. When one of the women runs over a stranger on the road near their house, a battle of wits between the two women in triggered.</p>
<p>Also in 1997, her third screenplay adaptation <span style="font-style:italic">A Thousand Acres</span> was filmed. The film was based on the novel by Jane Smiley of the same name, which itself was an adaptation of Shakespeare's <span style="font-style:italic">King Lear.</span></p>
<p>In 1998, <span style="font-style:italic">Oscar and Lucinda</span> was released. Written by Jones, the film was an adaptation of Peter Carey's award winning novel. In 1999, <span style="font-style:italic">Angela's Ashes</span> was released. The film was her adaptation of Frank McCourt's memoir of the same name.</p>
