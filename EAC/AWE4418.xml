<biogHist>
<abstract>Elizabeth Macquarie, the wife of New South Wales Governor, Lachlan Macquarie, was an active supporter of her husband's plan to transform the penal settlement at Sydney into a thriving settler colony. She is said to have taken a an interest in the welfare of women convicts and the local Aboriginal people. Her significant role in the establishment of the colony is memorialised in many landmarks in and around Sydney, New South Wales, including Mrs Macquarie's Chair, Campbelltown and the various Elizabeth Streets that pepper the map of Sydney.

She and another prominent Elizabeth (Macarthur) the wife of prominent colonial pastoralist John Macarthur, helped to introduce haymaking to New South Wales.</abstract>
<p>Elizabeth Macquarie was a 'gently born' Scots woman, without fortune, who grew up on her brother's estate at Appin, Scotland. She me Colonel Lachlan Macquarie, a widower and a distant cousin, in 1804 at the age of 26. They became engaged in 1805.</p>
<p>They married in Devon on 3 November 1807. The bride was 29, the groom 46. In September 1808 their first child, a daughter named Jane Jarvis after the first Mrs Macquarie, was born, but she died in December. In 1809 Macquarie was appointed governor of New South Wales. His wife accompanied him to the colony, where they landed, in Sydney, on December 31, 1809. Their second child, a boy named Lachlan, was born on 28 March 1814.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was a strong willed and determined woman and a devoted wife. She was an intrepid traveller, and her surviving 1809 journal of the voyage to Australia reveals a lively and inquisitive mind. Though dogged by ill health for much of her later life, she accompanied Lachlan on all of his major journeys throughout New South Wales and Tasmania. Recent histories have also indicated that she took an active role in instigating, designing and supervising many of the public works programs that her husband implemented during his time as Governor. She fully supported his efforts to transform a penal settlement into a thriving settler colony.</p>
<p>After her husband resigned as Governor, admidst criticism and controversy over the administration of the colony under his leadership, the couple returned to Britain, to live at Macquarie's estate, Jarvisfield on Mull, Scotland. Lachlan died in 1824.</p>
<p>After his death, she continued to work tirelessly to promote the memory of his achievement, most graphically by making the claim on Macquarie's tombstone inscription that his character and services to society 'rendered him truly deserving the appellation by which he has been distinguised: THE FATHER OF AUSTRALIA.'</p>

<abstract>Elizabeth Macquarie was born in 1778 in Scotland. She married Colonel Lachlan Macquarie in Devon on 3 November 1807. In 1809 Macquarie was appointed governor of New South Wales, Elizabeth Macquarie accompanied her husband to the colony and kept a vivacious account of the seven month voyage to New South Wales.

The journal describes the voyage from England to Sydney on board the Dromedary and describes several ports of call including Madeira, Rio de Janeiro and Cape Town. Elizabeth Macquarie comments on the events on the ship and daily activities whilst in port, such as places visited, church services attended and visits to and from friends. Mrs Macquarie also mentions that the frequent topic of conversation on board the ship was the state of the colony including Captain Bligh and the events surrounding the Rum Rebellion. Mrs Macquarie mentions people on the voyage including Judge Advocate Ellis Bent and his wife, General and Mrs Mead and Captain John Pascoe of the Hindostan
Rather than recording her experiences on a daily basis, it appears that Mrs Macquarie wrote up her impressions at specific times on the voyage or during port stopovers in Rio or Cape Town.</abstract>
