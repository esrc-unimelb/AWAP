<biogHist>
<abstract>Claire Douglas was a well known local candidate who nearly won the safe Liberal seat of Albury. She ran as an Independent candidate there for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1999 and 2003. Claire was successfully elected to the Albury City Council from 1999-2004.</abstract>
<p>Claire Douglas is a long time resident of Albury. She was educated at the universities of Monash, Sydney and Melbourne and has tertiary qualifications in Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Dietetics, Sports Nutrition and Education.</p>
<p>She has been continually active in local affairs. She has chaired, convened or been an active member many organizations, including Save our City, Wonga Wetlands, Mirambeena Community Centre Management Committee, Albury Regional Arts Board and Regional Art Gallery, West Albury Community Garden and East Albury landcare Group. She was active on the school committees of the schools her children attended.</p>
<p>She was elected to the Albury City Council in 1999 and was Deputy Mayor in 2003. She narrowly lost the 1999 election, only 621 votes behind the Liberal who was elected. She ran a strong campaign against the plan for a freeway through Albury but in 2003, with more candidates running, and a campaign against her suggesting that she was a one issue candidate, she was beaten more easily.</p>
