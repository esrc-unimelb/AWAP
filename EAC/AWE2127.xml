<biogHist>
<abstract>Dorothy Buckland-Fuller is a sociologist and social activist of some longstanding, with a distinguished career in ethnic and multicultural politics, particularly as they impact upon women of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. She is a peace activist, an environmentalist, a feminist and committed to the cause of reconciliation with indigenous Australia. Of Greek heritage, Buckland-Fuller has had a long involvement with the Greek Community of New South Wales, and her valuable contributions were acknowledged in 2001 when she was granted Life Membership to the Council of the Greek Orthodox Community of Sydney and New South Wales. In 1974, she established the Australian-Migrant Women's Association, an organisation designed to bring together immigrant and Australian-born women. Among other things, she is still actively involved in the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, serving as president in 2002-4. As a sociologist, she taught and conducted action research. Her life has been a case of putting that theory to practice. In her own words, she is an 'action oriented person'.</abstract>
<p>Dorothy Buckland-Fuller's extensive CV, when read chronologically and with regard to her own memories, is a living history of the development of multicultural policies in Australia. She arrived in Australia in 1961, having lived in England for the previous fourteen years. (Her husband was an engineer working for the British Overseas Air Corporation [BOAC].) She became involved with the Greek Community in Sydney and worked for them in the late 1960s in a part time capcaity as a secretary and Community Development Planner. While working, she studied at the University of New South Wales, completing her BA in 1969, and her MA Qual (the equivalent of Honours) in Sociology in 1972. She then commenced post graduate studies in the newly developing research area, 'The sociology of migration'. While a postgraduate, she worked in the New South Wales Health Department, in schools and Baby Health Centres undertaking research. She also lectured and tutored in various departments at the University of New South Wales. Her research was presented as part of a report entitled <span style="font-style:italic">Participation</span> to the New South Wales Parliament in 1978, and was regarded as pioneering in its focus on migrant women's issues and needs.</p>
<p>The list of Dorothy's paid and voluntary positions is extensive, as is the list of awards and acknowledgements for her services to the community. The list below is indicative and by no means exhaustive.</p>
