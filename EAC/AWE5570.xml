<biogHist>
<abstract>The Women Lawyers' Association of South Australia was incorporated in July 1998, although the need for a women's association had been discussed well before then and was long in the making.

On 21st September 1988 a meeting was held at the Law Society to discuss forming a women lawyers group. Over 95 women attended and 60 more sent their apologies. This represented more than half of the women practising law at that time and clearly indicated that the concept of a women lawyers committee or group had considerable support.

The Women Lawyers Committee of the Law Society was formally established in April 1989. A volunteer committee took responsibility for running the section, which has continued to this day. Following the establishment of Australian Women Lawyers in 1997, the Women Lawyers Association of South Australia Inc. has operated as an independently incorporated body, although their activities remain intertwined with those of the Women Lawyers Committee of the Law Society.</abstract>
