<biogHist>
<abstract>Nora Fisher represents the Women's Royal Australian Army Corps (WRAAC) Association of New South Wales on the Australian Women in War Project working group. Fisher has been active in both the state and national WRAAC Associations since joining in 1977. She has been the New South Wales secretary and editor of the newsletter <span style="font-style:italic">Best Times.</span> Fisher is the current secretary of the WRAAC Association Australia.</abstract>
<p>The daughter of Leslie Gladstone and Norah Cecilia (n√©e Keane) Fisher, Nora Fisher attended St Aidens Parish School Maroubra, with the Brigidine Nuns. After qualifying for the Intermediate Certificate Fisher joined the New South Wales Public Service (1944) and worked as an office assistant with the Department of Education. In 1954 she transferred to the New South Wales Public Works Department, where she passed specific Public Service Examinations which entitled her to be designated a 'Clerk'. This was somewhat unusual at the time and presented a problem for the Department. Eventually she was granted a Male Grade 1 clerical position and then preceded through the Graded positions to Grade 8 - again, not usually an opportunity for females. Fisher retired in 1985 and was awarded the New South Wales Government Medal for Meritorious Service.</p>
<p>On 10 June 1953 Nora Fisher enlisted in the Women's Royal Australian Army Corps Civilian Military Force (WRAAC CMF), Regimental Number F2/1523. She was one of the first 100 to enlist in the newly formed 4 WRAAC Company in 'P' Block, Victoria Barracks. Her commitment was one night per week, some weekends and a 14 day camp. After a year of recruit training Fisher was detached to training Corps. She was sent to Corps Signals where she and a group of WRAAC trained with National Servicemen and volunteers in the use of the signalling equipment of the time, i.e. wireless, teleprinter, and torn tape (punched tape). Although detached to the Signals Corps, Fisher was required to attend Parades at the WRAAC Company, assist with training and at recruit camps. She paraded at Georges Heights, Lidcombe, Dundas, and Victoria Barracks. Camps were conducted in Gan Gan Military Camp (near Nelsons Bay) and sometimes at the Sigs Units at Lidcombe, Dundas, and Georges Heights when she was 'rationed and quartered' (WRAAC School). </p>
<p>During her service with the WRAAC, Fisher was promoted from Corporal to Sergeant, Lieutenant and Captain. She transferred to the Reserve of Officers on 13 August 1964 - serving 11 years and 2 months.</p>
