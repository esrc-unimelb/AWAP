<biogHist>
<abstract>Dorothy Dunn lost her husband in the 1979 Streatham, Victoria bushfires. She decided to continue to run their farm on her own, and quickly realised that farming in Australia was seen as a male profession. The contribution of women was invisible, and they had little influence in decision making at any level. In 1992 she attended a meeting of similar minded women in Ballarat, Victoria, convened by Liz Hogan, a Project Officer with the Rural Women's Network. Out of the meeting, the peak body Australian Women in Agriculture was formed, with Dorothy as inaugural president. Her presidency and long history of work as an advocate for the role of women in agricultural policy making was recognised with an AO in 1999.</abstract>
<p>1988-94: Councillor, Shire of Ararat. Dorothy Dunn has also been involved in her local community as Secretary of the development committee, and as a member of the Central Highlands Rural Finance Counselling Service. Her service to the development of her rural community was acknowledged with the award of a Centenary Medal in 2001.</p>

Upon retirement from the Presidency, Dorothy remained as a Board Member for the following year, and was at the same time (1997-99) a member of the Victorian Rural Women's Reference Group for the Office of Rural Affairs, Department of National Resources and Environment.</p>
