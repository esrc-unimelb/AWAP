<biogHist>
<abstract>Muriel Heagney worked tirelessly for the labour movement in various capacities during her long life. Her major commitment, however, was to achieve equal pay for women workers. Born into a labour family, she joined the Richmond branch of the Political Labour Council (later the Australian Labor Party - ALP) in 1906, and was a delegate to the Women's Central Organising Committee in 1909. Other positions she held included: membership of the Victorian central executive of the Australian Labor Party from 1926-1927; secretary of the Women's Central Organising Committee; and ex officio member of the party's central executive in 1955. She was a founding member of the Council of Action for Equal Pay which was established in Sydney in 1937 under the auspices of the New South Wales branch of the Federated Clerks' Union and was secretary for most of its existence. It disbanded in 1948. She returned to Victoria in 1950 and continued to maintain her union and political interests into the 1960s. Her publications include <span style="font-style:italic">Are women taking men's jobs?</span>, (1935), <span style="font-style:italic">Equal pay for the sexes</span>, (1948), <span style="font-style:italic">Arbitration at the crossroads</span>, (1954). She died in poverty in St Kilda in May 1974.</abstract>
<p>Heagney made two attempts to enter an Australian parliament. She made her first attempt in 1933 when she stood as an ALP candidate in the by-election for the state Legislative Assembly seat of Boroondara, which was held on 29 April. This was and remains a conservative seat. She was placed second in a field of seven on the primary vote, with 20.54 per cent of the vote, but on the two-party preferred count she was placed third, with 24.36 per cent of the vote, after the winner Trevor Oldham (United Australia Party) and James Nettleton, another United Australia Party candidate. This was a creditable performance as the ALP had not fielded a candidate for that seat in the 1932 state election.<br />
She made her second attempt in 1956 at the age of 70, when she stood unsuccessfully for ALP pre-selection to the Australian Senate.</p>
