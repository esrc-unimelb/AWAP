<biogHist>
<abstract>The Australian Local Government Women's Association (ALGWA) was formed in Canberra in 1951. A non-party, not for profit organisation, the formation of the Association was inspired by the belief that more women should be involved in local government both as elected members and senior managers.

As of 2008, its aims were:
To assist in furthering knowledge and understanding of the function of local government
To encourage women to participate in local government
To encourage women to make a career in local government
To watch over and protect the interests and rights of women in local government
To take action in relation to any subject or activity affecting local government and local government legislation
To act in an advisory capacity to intending women candidates for local government election.

The Association has branches in all Australian states and the Northern Territory and membership is open to all intersted in encouraging and supporting women's participation in the Local Government sector.</abstract>
<p>1951 was the jubilee year of the Commonwealth of Australia, a Jubilee Women's Convention was held in Canberra as part of the celebrations. It was at this event that the ALGWA was formed. Ellen Weeks of Alexandra Shire, Victoria, was elected foundation president. The national body lapsed for some years, but was revived in 1966 with the development of strong branches of the movement in each State. Biennial national conventions were held from this time.</p>
