<biogHist>
<abstract>Women's Action Against Global Violence (WAAGV) was formed in Sydney in the early 1980s, as an organisation that aimed to support "women and children of all races and cultures in their struggle against violence and oppression". WAAGV was distinctly anti-nuclear, citing the nuclear arms race and its direct link to uranium mining, as well as the desecration of Australian Aboriginal land, the endangerment of workers' health and environmental instability as the basis for the group's opposition to uranium mining.

WAAGV organised and supported numerous protests and events, including the Pine Gap Peace Camp, 1983, an all women's peace camp at Lucas Heights, women's only dances and a 'Die-In', a peaceful action that was intended as a symbolic representation of nuclear attack. The group felt that it was necessary to retain a women only composition as it provided an environment where women could speak out, enabling a correction of a gender imbalance that was identified within the decision making process in other groups.

They had strong links to other women's peace groups including Feminist Anti-Nuclear Group (FANG) and Women Agaist Nuclear Energy (WANE) in Adelaide.</abstract>

<unitdate>21 April 1980 - </unitdate>
<abstract>Women Against Nuclear Energy (WANE) was formed out of a growing concern for, and a desire for action on, uranium mining and nuclear power. The women who founded WANE were members of the Campaign Against Nuclear Energy (CANE) but felt that sexism inherent in the hierarchical structure of CANE left women's voices unheard. As such, the members of WANE felt that their direction and means for attaining their goal of a nuclear-free future had diverged from that of CANE, and WANE was formed. The two groups maintained strong links, as well as links to other women's anti-nuclear groups and women's peace groups.

WANE's objectives included educating and activation of women, outside of appealing to women as mothers and carers. The exclusion of males was felt to better enable this, providing women with an environment free from the constraints of sexism that were felt to be inherent in the hierarchical structure of other anti-nuclear groups.
WANE aimed to work with women's groups in unions against uranium, and educate and empower women to share this message amongst other women. The group's primary concerns were regarding a nuclear-free future, as well as support for migrant and Indigenous women, and the support and investigation of alternative energy. WANE believed the implications of a solar future where inherent in feminist theory (for example, people before profits).
WANE produced and distributed a newsletter to its members. The group also helped organise Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament (WAND), supported women's only actions such as the Sound Women's Peace Camp in Western Australia and held dances to raise money.
