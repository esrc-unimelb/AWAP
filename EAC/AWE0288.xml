<unitid>OH3013</unitid>
<unitdate>1955 - 2000</unitdate>
<abstract>Dee Margetts discusses her background and education, she being particularly interested in the sociology of industrial development, economics and social policy. She was involved with the Peace movement in W.A. before entering politics and then being elected to the Senate for W.A. in 1993. She gives her views on the federal political scene and some of the problems faced in maintaining an ideological stance against the pressures of political compromise. She points out that there were disadvantages in being a W.A. Senator due to the distances needing to be travelled. Dee relates how she came in contact with many business and community groups that had problems for which other political parties didn't seem to have the right answers. She gives examples of some of the economic problems that she had to speak out on and try to find creative solutions for, as a Greens Senator. She felt that some of the more important issues that were raised in the Committee stages of Senate debates were not reported effectively by the Press Gallery - some questioned said the topics were too complex for them - and that the influence of spin doctors was not good. The Greens pushed the line and spoke out on many issues that made them unpopular. She puts forward her views on constitutional change and the relationships between local, state and federal government. What communities want and how citizens can play a meaningful role in decision making are important parts of Constitutional change, the nature of Federation and the separation of powers. She concludes with anecdotes about her experiences in the Senate, fellow politicians and issues that she was involved with as a Greens Senator from Western Australia, particularly logging, Manjimup protests and the Regional Forests Agreement.
