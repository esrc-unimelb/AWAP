<abstract>Barbara Hardy, n√©e Begg, was born at Largs Bay, Adelaide. She attended Woodlands Girls' School and began a science degree at Adelaide University aged 16. She married Tom Hardy in 1948. During the 1950s and 60s family and sport were Barbara's chief interests, however camping holidays also awakened her concern for the environment. In 1972 she began voluntary work with the Conservation Council and in 1974 started a degree in earth sciences at Flinders University. With growing expertise as a lobbyist, Barbara assisted David Wotton, Shadow and then Minister for the Environment in the late 70s and early 80s. Her husband died in 1980. Barbara resigned from the Liberal Party so that her activism could be non-party based, and since then has applied her 'patience, persistence and perspiration' to many organisations and issues, including the Australian Heritage Commission, Landcare, the National Parks Foundation and the Science and Technology Centre.</abstract>

<unittitle>The River Murray - Test Case for the Environment and the Constitution: A Public Forum [sound recording]</unittitle>
<unitid>OH 424</unitid>
<abstract>A recording of a public forum presented by the Constitutional Centenary Foundation in association with the State Library of South Australia entitled 'The River Murray - Test Case for the Environment and the Constitution' and held in the Institute Building of the State Library of South Australia. The purpose of the forum is to explore how the River Murray, a key issue in the Adelaide session of the 1897-1898 Australasian Federal Convention, has remained a classic issue of relations between South Australia and the federal government. John Bannon, convenor of the SA Chapter of the Foundation, introduces Emeritus Professor John Lovering, President of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission who speaks to the topic The River Murray - constitutional solutions or complications; Dr Barbara Hardy, scientist and environmentalist, who speaks to the topic Science, the environment and the constitution in collaboration; and Dr Chris Reynolds, senior lecturer in constitutional and environmental law at Flinders University, who speaks to the topic The environment and the constitution.
