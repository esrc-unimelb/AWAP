She ran as a member of the Country Party in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Dubbo, 1947 (known as Harvey), in the Senate in 1951 and 1953 for Gwydir (now known as Kirkby) and in Kirkby's 1953 by election for the House of Representatives.</abstract>

Widowed in 1946, she stood for the Country Party in the NSW Legislative Assembly seat of Dubbo in 1947 and was narrowly defeated.</p>
<p>In 1949 she married Kenneth Kirkby. She ran for the Senate in 1951 and 1953, unsuccessfully, on the Country Party ticket. She was one of two Country Party candidates for the Federal seat of Gwydir in a by election in 1953, and was again unsuccessful.
