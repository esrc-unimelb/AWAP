<biogHist>
<abstract>As a writer and editor, Peg Job contributes to a number of Australian newspapers and magazines. She has published on subjects ranging from human rights to travel and literary criticism, and has produced short stories, poetry and one novel, <span style="font-style:italic">The Dying</span>.</abstract>
<p>From Latin America to Braidwood via Narrabundah and from writer and editor to marriage celebrant, in Peg Job's life of variety her commitment to community has remained a constant. Graduating from the University of New South Wales in 1989 with a PhD in Latin American literature, Job was so struck by the kind welcome she received from her Narrabundah neighbours on her arrival in the suburb in 1990 she paid tribute to it in 'In Praise of Narrabundah', a short story in the 1992 collection <span style="font-style:italic">Stories of the Inner South</span>.[1]</p>
<p>Working to earn enough money during this period - as a columnist for the <span style="font-style:italic">Canberra Times</span>, a freelance reviewer and an adult-education coordinator - Peg Job's true needs were to read, think and write: 'A good book - which in my case is most commonly a novel - is a way of grappling with the meaning in life, with the essence of being human. What could be a more important responsibility for a thoughtful citizen than pursuing these questions?'.[2]</p>
<p>As a contributor to numerous Australian newspapers and magazines, she has published in a number of genres: literary criticism, human rights, travel writing, a novel <span style="font-style:italic">The Dying</span>, short stories, and has even tried her hand at poetry written in Spanish. Her love of literature and a move to Braidwood, 109 kilometres east of Canberra, was manifested in the opening of 'Peg's Books' on Monkittee Street in 1997. While 'Peg's Books' suffered an early demise due to the introduction of GST on books in 2000, Job's involvement with books and writing has continued.</p>
<p>As Editor with the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia (ASSA) Peg Job currently produces their journal <span style="font-style:italic">Dialogue</span> and various Academy publications. The Academy is an autonomous, non-governmental organisation devoted to the advancement of knowledge and research in the social sciences.</p>
<p>Peg Job's commitment to social and community betterment is demonstrated by her endorsement of the Wellbeing Manifesto that takes as its starting point the belief that governments in Australia should be devoted to improving our individual and social wellbeing.</p>
<p>As an inhabitant of Braidwood, a township which has been classified by the National Trust in its entirety, Peg Job is well able to exercise her passion for creating inclusive and active communities. Activities such as belonging to the a capella group <span style="font-style:italic">Madrigala</span>, and acting as a qualified civil marriage celebrant enable her to embrace the communion of life and love in a rural township.</p>
