<biogHist>
<abstract>Elizabeth Beveridge was a Foundation member and President of the Country Women's Association (CWA) in Tasmania.</abstract>
<p>Elizabeth Beveridge (n√©e Reader) immigrated to Australia with her family while she was still a child. She married Frank Beveridge of "Alva" Hagley at St Andrews Church Launceston, in 1912. They were to have three children.</p>
<p>Prior to marrying, Elizabeth assisted at a small private Progressive School at Trevallyn. She also taught music and singing. After her marriage she continued to conduct award-winning mixed and children's choirs. She became well known in musical and literary circles, especially for her love of monologues and readings. A keen gardener and embroiderer, Elizabeth contributed to all facets of life in her community. She helped raise money for charity through her "Concert Party" which she organised and toured to country centres. During World War II, she conducted community singing to raise money for the Comforts Fund, and introduced camouflage net making classes. </p>
<p>Elizabeth strongly supported the Show Judges Association, Child Health Clinics and the Red Cross Society. She was President of the Wilmot Branch of the Australian Women's National League. She was organist at the Hagley Presbyterian Church, where she taught Sunday school and organised Fairs and Flower Shows.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was honoured by being named Patron of the Hagley Community Club and Hagley Farm School, where she taught music and drama. A memorial to her is located in the Hagley Recreation Ground and trees are planted in her memory.</p>
