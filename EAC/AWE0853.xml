<abstract>History of Nursing in South Australia 

Joyce Kitto was born in Gladstone, South Australia. She spent most of her youth in Adelaide where she completed primary schooling, attended business college, and took an appointment in a office. In the early 1950s Joyce became a member of the Citizens' Military Force Nursing Corps, which led to her decision to train as a nurse. She was a student nurse at Mount Gambier Hospital from 1954 to 1957. After midwifery training in Launceston she worked in Port Pirie and then became a tutor sister at the Port Augusta Hospital. In 1963 she studied at the College of Nursing, Australia in Melbourne for the Sister Tutor Diploma, and returned to Port Augusta for three years. In 1970 she was appointed tutor sister in charge of the newly established training school for enrolled nurses at Gleneden, Maryattville, where she remained until her retirement in 1985.
