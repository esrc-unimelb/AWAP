<p>Marylyn Mayo graduated with Bachelor degrees in Law and Arts as one of a small group of female law graduates at the University of Auckland in New Zealand in the 1960s. After being admitted as a barrister and solicitor by the Supreme Court of New Zealand, she worked in private practice before joining the Ministry of Works as Auckland District Solicitor.</p>
<p>Mayo began lecturing in law in 1969 at Queensland's Townsville University College, which later became James Cook University of North Queensland. As a woman in a predominately male academic field, she was an inspirational mentor for many women in North Queensland. She realised her dream of establishing a full law degree at James Cook University in 1989 and was the Foundation Head of the School of Law and acting Dean until 1990, after which she continued lecturing. Marylyn was deputy Dean until 1993. In addition to lecturing, she published articles and presented at conferences. She retired from academic life in 1996.</p>
<p>Marylyn served on several boards and committees, including the Chair of the Townsville Hospital Ethics Committee, and membership of the University and National Health and Medical Research Council Ethics Committee. She also served on various university committees, including the University Council, Academic Board and Promotions Committee. She was president of James Cook University Staff Association and an active member of the James Cook University Branch of the National Tertiary Education Union. Marylyn died in 2002 and has several lectures and scholarships named in her honour.</p>
