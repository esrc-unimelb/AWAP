<unitdate>c. 1 December 1921 - 26 September 1981</unitdate>
<abstract>This series consists of about 195 photographs, four sound recordings and four films relating to Prime Minister Harold Edward Holt and his wife, Mrs Zara Holt (later Dame Zara). The material mainly covers the period when Holt was Prime Minister (1966-1967), although many of the photographs relate to his earlier career, particularly as Minister for Immigration (1949-1956). Several items relate specifically to Mrs Holt.

The photographs include official portraits, family photographs, Australian News and Information Bureau and other official photographs covering a wide range of Holt's official engagements both in Australia and overseas. A number of the photographs relate to Mrs Zara Holt as wife of a senior political figure, both before and after Holt's death. A few relate to the first year of her subsequent marriage to another politician, H J P (Jeff) Bate and to her fashion business 'Magg'.

Two of the sound recordings relate to Holt. One of these includes the speeches made at the historic Commonwealth Parliamentary Association luncheon given in Westminster Hall, London in May 1953, when Holt was Chairman of the Association, and the other is a recording of the speech he gave at the 36th Session of the International Labour Conference the same year. The other two recordings are the song 'Dame Zara', by the group 'The Wheelbarrow', and a cassette tape of Mrs Holt responding to 'Dorothy Dix' questions.</abstract>

<unitdate>8 October 1946 - 29 December 1997</unitdate>
<abstract>This series consists of the personal papers of Dame Zara Holt, wife of former Prime Minister Harold Edward Holt. These mainly cover the period 1946 to 1989,
although several items were accumulated subsequently by her eldest son Nicholas.

Correspondence, newspapers, press cuttings and magazines account for most of the records in the series. Many of these items relate to the death of Holt in December 1967 and his memorial services in Melbourne a few days later and in Westminster Abbey, London in January 1968. Some include complete issues of major daily Australian newspapers and press cuttings from US newspapers, collected by the Australian News and Information Bureau in New York. The correspondence includes two files of condolences addressed to Nicholas Holt, one relating to Holt's death and the other to Dame Zara's death in June 1989. Another file includes a list of Holt's personal papers deposited in the National Archives by the Prime Minister's Department in 1968 and an inventory of his personal effects.

Other items in the series relate to an overseas visit the Holts made in 1957, social engagements, fashion (including Dame Zara's fashion business 'Magg') and to members of the Holt family in more recent years.</abstract>
