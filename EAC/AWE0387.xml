<biogHist>
<abstract>The Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS) was established in April 1941 when the Royal Australian Navy enrolled 14 women at HMAS Harman, the wireless telegraphy station near Canberra. It was a  non-combat branch of the Royal Australian Navy that, liike many of its sister services created during the Second World War, alleviated manpower shortages resulting from men being assigned to combat roles.

WRANS performed a variety of duties, inclduing working as telegraphists, coders and clerks; but also as drivers, education officers, mechanics, harbour messengers, cooks and sickberth attendants.They worked for intelligence organisations and as domestic staff at Government House, Yarralumla.

The Service was temporarily disbanded in 1948, but was re-formed in 1951 to help the RAN cope with manpower shortages. By 1959 the organisation was incorporated as a non-combatant (and thus non-seagoing) part of the permanent naval forces.

Women were permitted to serve aboard Australian naval ships in 1983, which meant that WRANS personnel were fully integrated into the Royal Australian Navy. This being the case, 1984 the WRANS was premanently disbanded.</abstract>
<p>The Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS) was initially established with 14 females trained by Florence McKenzie as wireless telegraphists. The Royal Australian Navy enrolled the first 14 girls in April 1941 at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic">Harman</span> Wireless Telegraphy station. Later on 1 October 1942 they were sworn into the Navy as enlisted personnel with enlisted status. This is regarded as the formal foundation date for the organisation.</p>

<p>Four months later the number was increased to 1000. [1]</p>
<p>Patsy Adam-Smith, author of <span style="font-style:italic">Australian Women at War</span>, states that the service never exceeded 3000 women enlisted at one time.  In the WRANS women worked as telegraphists; coders; writers (typists and clerks); transport drivers; car drivers; office orderlies; dental mechanics; cooks; sickberth attendants; stewardesses; press relations officers (which included escorting the press to sea on trials); boarding officers; almoners; dome teacher operators (visual aids used for instruction and entertainment); education officers; vocational guidance;  sea transport officers; and air liaison officers (moving RAN officers and ratings to all parts of the globe). There were harbour messengers; an accountant officer; supply assistants; medical, clothing and general stores; a postmaster; a postal clerk (delivering mail to ships in port and on anchor); and watch keepers. There were WRANS working as Translation Interpretors in the Allied Translation Section of General MacArthur's main 'Order of Battle'. Some worked on the degaussing range (assessing the magnetic attraction of vessels as they crossed the degaussing range); they worked in ciphers; visual signalling; signals and communications; radio telegraphy plotting; and as messengers. Others were with the Radar Counter-measure, Allied Intelligence Bureau and Censorship Officers. They were at the Gunnery School, small arms range. One job was to handle all Safe Hand Mail for the port of Sydney, while another was to correct and issue charts to both merchant and naval ship's masters. There was an Assistant to the Staff Officer (Operations) Brisbane and another to the Director of Victualling.</p>
<p>Many WRANS were engaged on technical duties of a secret nature, working long hours under exacting conditions. For many, this meant absolute silence about their work, even after demobilisation, while the end of the war meant that others were released from secrecy. While the most senior men were adamant that WRANS would not work as mechanics, they did indeed work in ordnance artificers' workshops. Several women wore WRANS uniform merely for convenience or safety against the event of their being discovered and, as a civilian, being treated as a spy. [2]<br />
 <br />
The last wartime WRAN was discharged in 1948 when the WRANS were disbanded, but the service was reconstituted in 1951. By 1959 the WRANS were part of the Permanent Naval Forces, but Government policy of the day was that servicewomen not be employed in combat duties, and members of the WRANS were excluded from seagoing employment.</p>
<p>In 1985 women became fully integrated into the Royal Australian Navy and the WRANS were disbanded by an Act of Parliament. [3] </p>

<abstract>Whereas more conventional war memorials may incorporate a cenotaph or a representative figure, Anne Ferguson has created a bare platform of coloured stones, divided in two by a curved trench that resembles an aerial view of a river, carving its way through a sparse, flat landscape. While most memorials encourage audiences to keep a reverential distance, to stand outside the experience of war and reflect upon it, Ferguson wants the viewer to walk right into the middle of the work, to experience a sense of empathy with the women it celebrates. The insignia of the women's services are displayed discreetly around the mosaic, because for Ferguson, ceremony is far less important than the human dimension. For many women, the work they undertook during the Second World War provided a first taste of freedom and responsibility. When the war ended and those jobs were given back to the men, it must have come as a bitter blow, because their lives and way of thinking had already been changed. It is this sense of metamorphosis that Ferguson has tried to capture in her stone mosaic, in which the variegated colours represent the different lives, the different backgrounds and experiences of servicewomen. Set in a peaceful grove between the deciduous trees, the sculpture changes the appearance in relation to the changes in daylight, the play of shadows, and the sprinkling of leaves that fall haphazardly onto the stone. Ferguson draws a parallel between the gradual process of awakening to the environment in which we live, and a growing recognition of the debt we owe to those men and women who gave their time, and their lives, in defence of this land. Her stone platform may be undemonstrative, but it has a feeling of underlying strength. It is a foundation upon which new recognitions can be built.
