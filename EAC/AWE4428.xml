<biogHist>
<abstract>Margret RoadKnight was an activist in the women's liberation movement in Australia during the 1970s. She began her singing career in Melbourne in 1963. In 1973 she supported a women's liberation initiative, the She Concerts, which were held in Sydney and Melbourne. She was well-known for her song 'Girls in Our Town' which was one of the first songs to explore the isolation of young Australian married women living in suburbia. She has performed solo and in collaboration with many local and overseas performers, singing jazz, blues, folk, gospel and songs raising issues of social justice, both in Australia and overseas.</abstract>
