<abstract>The Sydney &amp; Metropolitan Ex-Prisoners of War Welfare Association was established in 1999 after the NSW Ex-Prisoner of War (POW) Association and the NSW Ex-Prisoner of War (POW) Ladies Auxiliary were disbanded.

The main objectives of the Association are to:
• affirm and promote loyalty to Her Majesty the Queen and the Commonwealth of Australia.
• protect and promote the interests of Ex-Prisoners of War, their spouses, and widows of Ex-Prisoners of War.
• promote friendship and good fellowship between members by way of meetings, visitations and welfare where necessary.
• collect, raise money and receive donations for the carrying out of these objects or for any charitable purpose or for the benefit directly or indirectly of Ex-Prisoners of War, their spouses, and widows of Ex-Prisoners of War.

Membership of the Association is open to any person who was a member of the New South Wales Ex-Prisoners of War Association Inc, or who would have been eligible to become a member. Members of the Ladies Auxiliary of the New South Wales Ex-Prisoners of War Association Inc, or any person who is a spouse or widow of an Ex-Prisoner of War, can make an application to become a member.

Members have regularly visited patients in their homes, nursing homes and hospitals, especially the Concord Repatriation Hospital (now Concord General Hospital). They have also involved themselves in specific projects such as obtaining special patient chairs for the Concord Repatriation Hospital or furniture for the Rose Garden at the hospital. These acquisitions were made with the help of members' fundraising activities including selling of poppies, Remembrance Day and Anzac Badges as well as running trade tables, garage sales and garden parties.</abstract>

<abstract>Four members of the Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS), ex-prisoners of war (POWs) of the Japanese, taking leave of family and friends who met them on their arrival at Mascot airport. They are carrying bouquets of flowers and standing in front of a car displaying a "Returned POW" banner. They are about to leave by bus for the 113th Australian General Hospital (113AGH) where they will be medically examined. The four were among six Australian army nurses captured at Rabaul in 1942 along with seven civilian administrative nurses, four Methodist missionary nurses, and a civilian housewife. They were all transported to Japan and interned at Yokohama. Left to right: Captain Kay Parker, Lieutenant (Lt) Lorna Whyte; Lt Daisy 'Tootie' Keast; Lt Mavis Cullen.</abstract>
